Problem:
-------
USDT in the bridging contract was at risk since the attacker was minting a large amount of OFD in the frontrun attack

Solutions:
-----------
The OFDPS in the initial multisig has been used today to mint OFD and to secure the USDT in the bridge. 

There will be a updated version 2 of OFD in near future - the new version will not be able to frontrun

Consequence:
-------------
Please do not interact with the Oracle Free Dollar frontend or the Oracle Free Dollar procol until the code is updated.

All users will have the same amount of OFDPS token in then updated version 2 of OFD as they had at the snapshot on nov 19th 

timeline:
----------
go-live v2 december 2024
